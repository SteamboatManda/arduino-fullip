Quick start
===========

Install FullIP:

- Download the library from github (https://github.com/bibi21000/arduino-fullip) and install it in your libraries

- Update FullIP.h according to your hardware

   - comment #define FULLIP_UIP to build with official shield (w5100) or
     uncomment it to build with enc28j60 and UIPEthernet
    
   - comment #define FULLIP_SD to disable SD or
     uncomment it to build ftpclient, httpserver, ...

In your sketch :

- import the Ethernet library or the UIPEthernet and the SD if needed :
.. code-block:: c

 // For W5100
 //You must also update FullIP/FullIP.h
 #include <SPI.h>
 #include <Ethernet.h> 
 //For enc28j60
 //You must also update FullIP/FullIP.h
 //#include <UIPEthernet.h>
 #include <SD.h>
 #include <FullIP.h>

- Define a client (FTP in this example)
.. code-block:: c

 FtpClient ftpclient;
 

- Start it in your setup
.. code-block:: c

 ftpclient.begin(server_name,user_name,password);

- Get the file
.. code-block:: c
 
 ftpclient.getFile(filename,local_dir,remote_dir);

- And process it in your loop
.. code-block:: c

 ftpclient.maintain();

That's all !!!
