FullIP is a suite of ip protocols implementation for Arduino.

* Download the library from github : https://github.com/bibi21000
  /arduino-fullip.

* Install it in your libraries. Rename the directory to FullIP.

* If you want to use FullIP with enc28j60, install the UIPEthernet
  library : https://github.com/ntruchsess/arduino_uip.

* Restart Arduino IDE.

* Update FullIP.h according to your hardware :

  * comment #define FULLIP_UIP to build with official shield (w5100)
    or uncomment it to build with enc28j60 and UIPEthernet.

  * comment #define FULLIP_SD to disable SD or uncomment it to build
    ftpclient, httpserver, ...

* The pin CS are hardcoded in UIPEthernet and Ethernet libraires.
  Update the followings files if needed :

  * UIPEthernet/Utility/Enc28J60Network.h :

  * arduino-1.x/libraries/Ethernet/Utility/w5100.h (to do ...)
